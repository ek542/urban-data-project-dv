# trends/ 

This folder contains files with daily, weekly, and monthly data shown across time. Note that these trend data are published by date of event, not by date of report. The Health Department recommends against interpreting daily changes to these files as one dayâ€™s worth of data, due to the difference between date of event and date of report.

## Files 

### antibody-by-week.csv   

This file contains person-level information on antibody testing: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, stratified by week. Please see the technical notes  for a description of the different [types of COVID-19 laboratory tests](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#laboratory-testing). The dates shown in this table reflect the date of specimen collection (i.e., when someone went to a healthcare provider for a test).

People with an antibody test are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person whose blood was collected for antibody testing on Monday, October 12, 2020 would be categorized as tested during the week ending October 17, 2020. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. 

This file includes data since the week ending April 11, 2020 based on when the Health Department started to receive a higher volume of antibody tests following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC.

Indicators include:

| PERCENT_POSITIVE | Percentage of people tested with an antibody test who tested positive | Full week preceding the week-ending date |     
| INCOMPLETE | Used for display purposes only | |    

Note that one person can have more than one test during different weeks. Therefore, the sum of counts across weeks may not match summary values.  

### caserate-by-modzcta.csv 

This file contains the rate of cases per 100,000 people, stratified by week and three different geographies: citywide, borough, and modified ZIP Code Tabulation Area (MODZCTA). The level of geography is indicated following the underscore (_) in each column heading. Please see the technical notes for a [description of MODZCTA](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#geography-zip-codes-and-zctas).

People with COVID-19 are categorized based on the date of diagnosis, and are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Monday, October 12, 2020 would be categorized as diagnosed during the week ending October 17, 2020. Note that sum of counts in this file may not match values in citywide tables because of records with missing geographic information.

### cases-by-day.csv

### percentpositive-by-modzcta.csv 

This file contains the percentage of people tested for COVID-19 with a molecular test who tested positive, stratified by week and three different geographies: citywide, borough, and MODZCTA. The level of geography is indicated following the underscore (_) in each column heading. Please see the technical notes for a [description of MODZCTA](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#geography-zip-codes-and-zctas), the different [types of COVID-19 laboratory tests](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#laboratory-testing), and details on the [calculation of percent positivity](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#calculation-of-percent-positivity). The dates shown in this table reflect the date of specimen collection (i.e., when someone went to a healthcare provider for a test).

People with a molecular test are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who had a nasal swab collected for molecular testing on Monday, October 12, 2020 would be categorized as tested during the week ending October 17, 2020. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. Therefore, the number of tests conducted in a week will differ from the number of people tested (as reported in other files) for the same week.
  
### testing-by-age.csv

### testing-turnaround.csv

This file contains test-level information on molecular tests, stratified by week. Please see the technical notes for a description of the different [types of COVID-19 laboratory tests](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#laboratory-testing). The dates shown in this table reflect the date of specimen collection (i.e., when someone went to a healthcare provider for a test).

Molecular tests are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a nasal swab collected for molecular testing on Monday, October 12, 2020 would be categorized as tested during the week ending October 17, 2020.

This file includes data since the week ending March 7, 2020 based on when the Health Department started to receive a higher volume of molecular tests following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC.

| Variable Name | Definition | Timeframe |   
| -------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|   
| WEEK_END | Week-ending date | |       
| TESTS | Number of molecular tests conducted | Week |        
| PERCENT_24HR | Percent of molecular tests with results reported within 24 hours  | Full week preceding the week-ending date |     
| PERCENT_48HR | Percent of molecular tests with results reported within 48 hours | Full week preceding the week-ending date |     
| LAG_MEDIAN | Median turnaround time (half of molecular tests have results reported faster than this time), in days | Full week preceding the week-ending date |  
| LAG_25TH_PERCENTILE | 25th percentile turnaround time (1 out of 4 molecular tests have results reported *faster* than this time), in days | Full week preceding the week-ending date | 
| LAG_75TH_PERCENTILE | 75th percentile turnaround time (1 out of 4 molecular tests have results reported *slower* than this time), in days | Full week preceding the week-ending date | 

Note that one person can have more than one test on different days. Therefore, the number of tests conducted in a week will differ from the number of people tested (as reported in other files) for the same week.

### testrate-by-modzcta.csv 

This file contains the rate of molecular testing per 100,000 people, stratified by week and three different geographies: citywide, borough, and MODZCTA. The level of geography is indicated following the underscore (_) in each column heading. Please see the technical notes for a [description of MODZCTA](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#geography-zip-codes-and-zctas), and the different [types of COVID-19 laboratory tests](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#laboratory-testing). The dates shown in this table reflect the date of specimen collection (i.e., when someone went to a healthcare provider for a test).

People with a molecular test are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who had a nasal swab collected for molecular testing on Monday, October 12, 2020 would be categorized as tested during the week ending October 17, 2020. A person tested twice in one week would only be counted once in that week. Therefore, the number of tests conducted in a week will differ from the number of people tested (as reported in other files) for the same week.

### tests.csv   

This file contains person-level information on molecular and antigen testing: the number of people who received a test, the number of people with positive results, the percentage of people tested who tested positive, stratified by day and test type. Please see the technical notes for a description of the different [types of COVID-19 laboratory tests](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#laboratory-testing), and details on the [calculation of percent positivity](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data#calculation-of-percent-positivity). The dates shown in this table reflect the date of specimen collection (i.e., when someone went to a healthcare provider for a test).

This file includes data since March 3, 2020 based on when the Health Department started to receive a higher volume of molecular tests following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC. Please note that antigen testing started to become more widely available in NYC in October 2020. The Health Department consistently receives electronic reports *only* for COVID-19 tests that are conducted in laboratories, and tests that are conducted at point-of-care (e.g., antigen tests) may not be routinely reported to the Health Department, especially if the test result is negative.

Note that one person can have more than one test on different days. Therefore, the number of positive persons every day will be different from the counts of confirmed or probable cases, which will count people only on the first day they test positive.  

### weekly-case-rate-age.csv 

This file contains the rate of cases per 100,000 people, stratified by week and age group. 

People with COVID-19 are categorized based on the date of diagnosis, and are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Monday, June 21, 2021 would be categorized as diagnosed during the week ending June 26, 2021. Rates are suppressed if the count of the numerator is between 1 and 4, to prevent the display of unreliable rates.

This file contains the rate of cases per 100,000 people, stratified by week and race/ethnicity group. Rates are age-adjusted according to [the US 2000 standard population](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20.pdf).

People with COVID-19 are categorized based on the date of diagnosis, and are aggregated by full-weeks starting each Sunday and ending on Saturday. For example, a person who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Monday, June 21, 2021 would be categorized as diagnosed during the week ending June 26, 2021. Rates are suppressed if the count of the numerator is between 1 and 4, to prevent the display of unreliable rates.

Data on people identified as American Indian/Alaska Native, two or more races, or certain other races/ethnicities not listed are not included in this table. The Hispanic/Latino category includes people of any race. Race/ethnicity information is most complete for people who have been hospitalized or have died. There are much less data currently available on race/ethnicity for people who have not been hospitalized.

Differences in health outcomes among racial and ethnic groups are due to long-term institutional and personal biases against people of color. There is no evidence that these health inequities are due to personal traits. Lasting racism and an inequitable distribution of resources needed for wellness cause these health inequities. These resources include quality jobs, housing, health care and food, among others. The greater impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people of color shows how these inequities influence health outcomes.

### weekly-death-rate-age.csv
